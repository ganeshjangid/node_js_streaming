Node makes extensive use of streams as a data transfer mechanism.

For example, when you output anything to the console using the console.log function, you are actually using a stream to send the data to the console.

Node.js also has the ability to stream data from files so that they can be read and written appropriately. We will now look at an example of how we can use streams to read and write from files. We need to follow the below-mentioned steps for this example

Step 1) Create a file called data.txt which has the below data. Let assume this file is stored on the D drive of our local machine.

Step 2) Write the relevant code which will make use of streams to read data from the file.Node makes extensive use of streams as a data transfer mechanism.

For example, when you output anything to the console using the console.log function, you are actually using a stream to send the data to the console.

Node.js also has the ability to stream data from files so that they can be read and written appropriately. We will now look at an example of how we can use streams to read and write from files. We need to follow the below-mentioned steps for this example

Step 1) Create a file called data.txt which has the below data. Let assume this file is stored on the D drive of our local machine.

Step 2) Write the relevant code which will make use of streams to read data from the file.Node makes extensive use of streams as a data transfer mechanism.

For example, when you output anything to the console using the console.log function, you are actually using a stream to send the data to the console.

Node.js also has the ability to stream data from files so that they can be read and written appropriately. We will now look at an example of how we can use streams to read and write from files. We need to follow the below-mentioned steps for this example

Step 1) Create a file called data.txt which has the below data. Let assume this file is stored on the D drive of our local machine.

Step 2) Write the relevant code which will make use of streams to read data from the file.Node makes extensive use of streams as a data transfer mechanism.

For example, when you output anything to the console using the console.log function, you are actually using a stream to send the data to the console.

Node.js also has the ability to stream data from files so that they can be read and written appropriately. We will now look at an example of how we can use streams to read and write from files. We need to follow the below-mentioned steps for this example

Step 1) Create a file called data.txt which has the below data. Let assume this file is stored on the D drive of our local machine.
